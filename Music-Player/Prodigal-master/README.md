### Customizing Themes

See this [link](https://github.com/SpongeBobSun/Prodigal/blob/master/Themes.md) for customizing themes.



### Building

To build Prodigal for Android you need import the project in AndroidStudio.

Before you hit the run or debug button, you may need to run the `zipThemes` gradle task, which will zip the theme folder and copy it to `assets` folder.

After themes are zipped as assets, you can switch to the `app` configuration and hit the run button.
